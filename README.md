These models are trained with an ad-hoc designed database that contains information on more than two thousand plants developed for public social housing competitions in Catalonia and the Balearic Islands. In a similar environment, the transfer between the different means of operating architecture: graphics, numerical, diagrammatic, etc. is constant and as a result an informational and relational model is constituted on which to design qualities and procedures for the intensification of latent architectural intelligences.



### Machine Learning in Architecture Design 
We explore the impact of the quality of the data used to train different deep learning
models in the automatic generation of social housing layouts. To achieve this, we
conducted an analysis of the architectural consistency of RPLAN. Upon finding several
issues that raise doubts about its suitability for training social housing generation
models, we proceeded to create PUBLICPLAN, a new dataset based on highly
qualified proposals submitted in public architecture competitions in Spain. We
retrained the three most advanced existing models for generating interior plans using
PUBLICPLAN and compared their performance to the same models trained with
different subsets of RPLAN. Our results indicated that PUBLICPLAN had a significant
impact compared to the alternatives with a similar number of cases. This highlights the
importance of using qualified datasets in deep learning for the generation of social
housing layouts.
